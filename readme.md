# Spendyy - Private, Local-First Budget Tracker

Spendyy is a powerful budget analysis tool designed to be as private as you desire. It helps you track historical spending, manage custom categories, and measure progress against your financial goals‚Äîall while keeping your data securely on your own device.

**Your Data, Your Control:**
Spendyy runs entirely in your browser. All transaction data, categories, and settings are stored locally using your browser's `localStorage`. **Nothing is ever sent to a remote server unless you use the AI categorization.** This means you have complete control and ownership of your financial information. You can even watch your local data file grow as you add transactions and delete it completely at any time.

**AI-Assist for Easy Organization:**
To make categorizing transactions effortless, Spendyy includes an optional AI-assist feature powered by the Google Gemini API. This is an on-demand tool; your anonymized transaction details (payee and description) are only sent to the API when you explicitly ask for a suggestion. You can disable this feature entirely and manage your API key in the settings.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is built with Vite and React. It requires Node.js and npm to run locally.

### Demo

A live version of the application is available for demonstration at:
**[https://nospendyy.netlify.app](https://nospendyy.netlify.app)**

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) version 18.x or higher.
*   (Optional) A Google Gemini API Key if you wish to use the AI features. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables to handle the Gemini API key. For local development, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:

    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

    The application is configured to read this key. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent you from accidentally committing your secret key.

### Running Locally

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the local development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). The app will now be running with hot-reloading.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized static build of the application:

1.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  The output files will be generated in the `dist` directory. You can deploy this directory to any static web hosting service.
